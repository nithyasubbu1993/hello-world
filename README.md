# hello-world
My first personal (off-work) github account

Hi All,
This is my very first personal github account that I will be using for my side-projects
and other non-work purposes. Excited to have one separate for myself. I am sure I will 
have a lot fun reading and understanding other exciting work from other people. I do have a
school/work account which I was using (not extensively) until very recently but thought
I needed one dedicated account for myself for better organisation.
